# Data Viz Assignment - Student Loan Debt Over Time

This directory contains all my files associated with this an assignment from a data visualization course I took during my time at Columbia University's QMSS program. Everything was done using R.

Below is an introduction to the assignment and a description of the data used, as written by the instructor (Thomas Bramboor). 

## Scenario

Imagine you are a data scientist at a respected media outlet – say the “New York Times”. For a feature article provisionally called Indebted to Learn, your editor-in-chief asks you to analyze some data on the development of student loan debt over time and prepare some data visualizations in which you outline the main patterns around which to base the story.

Since there is no way that all features of the data can be represented in such a memo, feel free to pick and choose some patterns that would make for a good story – outlining important patterns and presenting them in a visually pleasing way.

The full background and text of the story will be researched by a writer of the magazine – your input should be based on the data and some common sense (i.e. no need to read up on this). It does help, however, to briefly describe what you are presenting and what it highlights.

Provide polished plots that are refined enough to include in the magazine with very little further manipulation (already include variable descriptions [if necessary for understanding], titles, source [e.g. “Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)”], right color, etc.) and are understandable to the average reader of the “New York Times”. The design does not need to be NYTimes-like. Just be consistent.

## Data

The main data comes from the Survey of Consumer Finances which is conducted every three years from 1989 onwards (last year in the data is 2016) and is provided as comma-separated text file, containing 55 variables for 238880 cases. The variables cover some details on household demographics, assets, debts, debt payments, income, net worth, and expenditures.

Note that the data file itself was too large to include.
